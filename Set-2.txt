Working with Stream


1. Create a function powers-of-2 that returns a stream of powers of 2

2. Create a function multiples-of that accepts a number n and produces a stream of multiples n

3. Create a function color-cycle that produces a stream representing the color-cycle of a 
	traffuc ligh (Green, Yellow, Red)

	Example:
		> take(10, color-cycle())
		[ list: Green, Yellow, Red, Green, Yellow, Red, Green, Yellow, Red, Green]

	Use this data definition for color:

	data Color: Green | Yellow | Red end
